/**
 * A basic screen for use with a {@link ScreenManager}. Screens are intended as
 * objects that are created once (when the game is started) and are then reused.
 * <p>
 * A screen starts rendering after it has been
 * {@linkplain ScreenManager#pushScreen(String, String, Object...) pushed}.
 * Every time a screen is pushed {@link #show()} is called before the rendering
 * commences, allowing you to (re)set the screen's state.
 * <p>
 * When the screen is shown for the first time, in addition to {@link #show()}
 * the {@link #create()} method is called. This method is intended to be used to
 * load any assets the screen may need or to setup the screen's UI. The screen
 * can also be {@linkplain #create() initialized} manually by calling
 * {@link #initializeScreen()}, which should normally be done by a loading
 * screen after the game's assets have been loaded centrally.
 * <p>
 * Use {@link #addInputProcessor(InputProcessor)} to add input processors that
 * are automatically registered and unregistered whenever the screen is
 * {@linkplain #show() shown}/{@linkplain #hide() hidden}.
